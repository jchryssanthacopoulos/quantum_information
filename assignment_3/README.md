# Assignment 3

The assignment instructions are contained in `Assignment3.pdf`.

## Installation

To compile the Fortran programs, make sure you have `gfortran` installed. The programs were compiled using version 11.2.0.

## Compilation

To compile the modules and programs, run:

```
./compile.sh
```

This stores the programs in the `compiled` directory. To clean out that directory, run:

```
./clean.sh
```

If you can't execute these shell scripts, be sure to make them executable for your user, for example:

```
chmod u+x compile.sh
```
